Splanchnic Nerve Chromaffin Cell Model 

   This model simulates the electrophysiology of a single splanchnic nerve
   chromaffin cell synapse.  This model incorporates selected voltage gated Na, K and Ca
   channels, buffering of Ca, and two populations of synaptic vesicles in the splanchnic buton.
   This model also incorporates AChE and ACh spillover/diffusion in the synaptic space.
   Lastly this model incorportates nAChR dynamics to measure expected EPSCs.
